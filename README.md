HTML guide: Included in release! Viewable in program!

Compared to Win10/online:

* Choose more optional stuff like including energy, blade, focus and getting builds like 3x blade, 2x energy/blade, energy/blade/focus
* Be intentionally vague to just mash runes for days until you get the stats you want.
* Filter out all the trash just for your best mons so their builds run in seconds.
* Run all your builds in order from best to last assigning runes, automatically locking runes out of later builds.
* Specify hard minimum/maximums for stats to get the sweet speed tune with speed totem and Verde lead.
* Optionally: outputs a spreadsheet that reviews your runes and build filters - WIP

# Usage

Just grab the zip from releases or something and run the .exe
You can load a save manually through File > Load, or it will attempt to load "save.json" if it exists in the same directory.

Double-clicking a monsters name will prompt you to specify a build

Clicking the arrow will run the selected build
Clicking the double-arrow will run all build

A huge mess, this started as a personal project but I'm cleaning it up.

It does enough of a job, probably not the most efficiently.
